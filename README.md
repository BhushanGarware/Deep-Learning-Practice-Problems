# Deep-Learning-Practice-Problems
This is a repository to provide information about some interesting Deep Learning Practice Problems. 
# First Problem
The first problem we would be looking is the [THE NEXAR CHALLENGE -1](https://www.getnexar.com/challenges/). It was a competition designed towards an accident free world. There are 18659 labeled training images given to find out if the traffic signal is green, red or no signal. Images are taken in the day time and in the night time. This is an amazing problem to test the capabilities of the convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 

## Theory 
Best place to learn CNNs is [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uiulzZxmGg) course

## Tools
1. [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) 
   I would recommend you to install Caffe locally on your machine. One of the biggest advantage of using Caffe is to have a place called [Caffe Zoo](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo), where you would get many interesting pre-trained neural network models.  I understand [installing Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html) is bit annoying stuff. Here are some guidelines:
- First install [Anaconda2](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).  People have reported many issues with Anaconda3 so it is better to go for Anaconda2 
- [OpenCV2](https://anaconda.org/menpo/opencv) 
- I would upload the complete tutorial for this separately.

2. [NVIDIA DIGITS](https://developer.nvidia.com/digits) is a deep learning platform for developing quick applications. It is an interactive GUI based on caffe platform. You can develop deep learning applications without writing single line of the code. SATYA MALLICK from [Learn OpenCV](http://www.learnopencv.com/) has amazing [tutorial](http://www.learnopencv.com/nvidia-digits-3-on-ec2/) for beginners for quick start of using Nvidia Digits platform. He has also created a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZaAcl_F9R0&list=PLAeuFh2kplHsM3azmgg0qRxgqgg__m_3_) for the same.

3. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open source Deep Learning Library by Google.
4. [Keras](https://keras.io/) is another  deep learning library. 
5. You can access AWS instance from [Putty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi7ow5NGC-U) on windows 

To try out your experimentations, I would recommend you to use CS231n's [public AMI](http://cs231n.github.io/). If you are interested to use [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) on EC2 then this [Tutorial](http://efavdb.com/deep-learning-with-jupyter-on-aws/) would be definitely helpful!
